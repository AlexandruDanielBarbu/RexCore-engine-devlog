# RexCore Engine Devlog

## What is RexCore? 🦖🦴

RexCore is a work in progress game engine developed using `C++` (standard 23) and `Vulkan`.

## Why develop an engine? You just reinvent the wheel…

Maybe, but a game engine is way more complex than the actual editor you have to get used to to actually make the game. There are a lot of behind the scenes things that are interesting and are worth investigating.

My interest is to become a better developer by working on this engine. There are a lot of tools that I want to get familiar with such as (but not limited to): C++, Vulkan, git and CMake.

## What is my goal with the engine? When will I stop?

To keep any project going I find it important to define a clear end goal. Although I mentioned I wanted to become more familiar with different tools, I also have some other reasons for building a game engine: to make a game.

My end goal is to make a GTAIII clone in a custom engine I made. Obviously I will not limit myself to blindly copying GTAIII, I’ll try to expand on it with features I always wanted to see in a GTA game.

### Why GTA?

GTA games are the reason I even considered pursuing a career in computer science and I hope that by the end of this project I would have a portfolio worthy of a Rockstar Games software engineer.

## Expected Roadmap

I plan to have a working render engine and a decent physics engine as well. Besides GTA, games like NFS are also my favourite, so having an accurate physical simulation of a car would be a nice thing for my end demo game.

What I think I will aim for in the beginning is:
1. Render a triangle on the screen
2. Render an object on the screen
3. Move camera in the scene
4. We will see 🙂.
